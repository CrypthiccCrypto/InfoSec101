# Bandit Level 14 to 15 Writeup

Author: [Soham Samaddar](https://github.com/CrypthiccCrypto)

Problem Page: [bandit14](https://overthewire.org/bandit/bandit14)

## List of Commands Used
```
nc - used to connect with another port
```

## Walkthrough
Initially, I had no idea what to do. Reading the manpages of each of the suggested commands gave me some idea that this level would probably involve the nc command. Following a tutorial on YouTube on netcat I was finally able to solve this level, albeit my understanding of this topic still remains shaky.
