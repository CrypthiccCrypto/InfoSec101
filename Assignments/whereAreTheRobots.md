# PicoGym Web Exploitation Writeup

Author: [Soham Samaddar](https://github.com/CrypthiccCrypto) (Mention your name, GitHub profile)

Challenge Page: [where are the robots](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/)


## Walkthrough
I spent the first 15 minutes aimlessly navigating through developer tools, trying to find anything of value. Then I remembered about a prior CTF challenge in picoCTF - Scavenger Hunt - which mentioned indexing specific elements of a website. Additionally, the challenge name itself mentioned "robots", so I searched for the robots.txt file, and sure enough, 1bb4c.html was not indexed.  

## Flag
`picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_1bb4c}`

## Useful resources (if any)
https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-indexing

## Suggested modifications [Optional]
What can you do to make this level more difficult. The inherent idea should be similar.
